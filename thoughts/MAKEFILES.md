### Introduction

When I first started coding in C at 42, Makefiles were a foreign concept to me. In the earliest days my brain felt like a sieve trying to hold onto an onslaught of information that was being hurled at me in such a short amount of time. Most core concepts were solid and stuck with me, but the finer liquid details managed to drip through all the same. The following sections will serve not only as a reference for my own personal use, but as an attempt to unpack what I have learned to help others that may be struggling the same way I did.

# Comprehension steps to success:

I think it is important to note that the key to my understanding in most facets of programming comes from the key concept of `code comprehension`. I think its very important to try to read other peoples work frequently and try to break down what they have done. 

* read each line critically. 
* cross-reference code with documentation. 
* pour over the usual forums.
* ask your peers for help when you are stuck.
* do not be afraid to admit that when you do no know something.
* never put something in your own work that you do not fully understand.

Today we are going to be using examples from an alum of 42, [qsto](https://github.com/qst0/), alongside the [GNU Make Man](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html)

Without further ado, lets jump right into it.
